# Scanner and discovery
the script make a scan discovery of a network, scan all ips and create a note about it.

# Create a keepnote report

Create a keepNote report scan of a network from cidr/ip giving in the parameters and create a note for each ip and also make a nmap scan and write all information. The idea is to simplify 

all steps of scanning and writing info, and also to have a great presentation and organisation of our report.

#### Nota:
We have to install keepnote to open the created report 

# Create a report of all discovered boxes in a subnet 192.148.43.0/24 :

```
./keepNoteScanNetReportCreator.sh l myreport /path/to/report/destination_directory 10.10.10.0/24
```
